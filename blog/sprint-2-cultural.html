      <h4>What is your long term goal and or career pathway?</h4>
      
      <p>Long term, I want to be working in wide-scope EdTech, designing programs that will help students and teachers learn better together. Firmly having one foot in both education and tech will help me to do this.</p>
      
      <h4>What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?</h4>
      
      I would like to develop skills in focus, context-shifting, and collaboration. More confidence with sharing my technical knowledge and "learning out loud". I would like to use EDA as a springboard to develop relationships and resources for building programs for techquity in schools.
      
      <h4>A description of your own strengths and limitations</h4> 
      
      <ul><legend>My strengths:</legend>
        <li>Humour: I don't take myself so seriously, and welcome the opportunity to laugh with others.</li>
        <li>Creativity: I love to be creative and expressing myself creatively, something which provides me with an endless source of energy and renewal.</li>
        <li>Curiosity/Love of learning: There are few things that don't inspire me to learn more. I am motivated by the idea of self-mastery and betterment.</li>
        <li>Work ethic and organisation: At my best, I am prudent with my time and responsibilities so I can use and serve all with the utmost efficiency.</li>
        <li>Tenacity/Determination: I have a deep resilience for mistakes and stumbles. I've made more than enough of them in my lifetime.</li>
        <li>Empathy/Compassion: I care about others and direct my energies to trying to make things better for everyone.</li>
        <li>Gratitude: I like to express gratitude to others as often as possible.</li>
      </ul>

      <uL><legend>Limitations:</legend>
        <li>Single-mindedness: In order to be as tenacious and determined as I am, previously I have had to be blinkered to the opinions of others that might otherwise have held me back. Over the last few years, I've turned my focus on being a better collaborator.</li>
        <li>Perfectionism: I am constantly working on the idea that "done is better than perfect".</li>
        <li>Frustration: As per the above point, I often internalise frustration when I'm not performing at my best.</li>
        <li>Directness: I can be blunt, which I appreciate in others, but I have to pair it with empathy/compassion to make sure I don't cause offence.</li>
      </uL>

      <p>Most of my limitations are the flip side of my strengths. For example, I have deep affective and cognitive empathy and compassion for others, but this can likewise become sensitivity, or alternately lack of certainty with appropriate action as to not offend or hurt others. I can be tenacious, for which I can credit some of my greatest accomplishments, but that also can sometimes mean single-mindedness. I love to learn, but in that plays my perfectionism, and it's hard to choose not to follow a new thread of thought in favour of focusing on one! I thrive through positive collaborative relationships, but sometimes I can also care too much about what other people think. My ongoing journey is simply about finding balance between my natural strengths and the inherent vulnerabilities they pose.

      <h4>Based on the above description, a commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include - an explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and sustainably with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives.</h4>
      
      <p>I will always endeavour to listen intently and engage primarily in all relationships with grace, humour, and kindness. I will direct by tenacity and determination to managing my time and energies so that I complete tasks within expected timeframes, while also facilitating my own growth in a sustainable way. I will make sure I sleep, eat, and manage my health in such a way that I can perform these tasks and maintain relationships in a positive and supportive way (for all).
      </p>
      <h4>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way.</h4>
      
      <p>If I believe a task is beyond my comprehension or abilities, I will reach out to the appropriate person(s) via Slack, e-mail, or other channels.
      </p>
      <h4>A description of what you expect from the facilitation team</h4>
      
      <p>Clear communication of expectations. Honestly, just to keep doing the awesome work they already do. It's truly exceptional and I'm grateful for it.
      </p>
      <h4>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whanau commitments such as school drop-offs. Itâ€™s important to plan these in.</h4>
      <p>At the moment, none bar the onoing discussions about what will happen around week 5 of bootcamp.</p>
