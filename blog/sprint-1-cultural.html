        <h4>Using the evidence gathered, describe your core personal values.</h4>
        <p>Justice is a powerful one. There is possibly nothing that angers me more than injustice. One of my mentors and kaihapai, MJ, says that anger is necessary to fuel us in the work we do - not directed at any one person, but as a fire that propels us beyond what we thought we were capable to dismantle oppression as it is called to us by the oppressed.
        </p>
        <p>Compassion and love: I believe that all beings are deserving of love, and that love is our purpose. That's it. Love just looks like different things, often. It's not always cuddles and kisses and permissiveness. It's sometimes working late into the night to create learning tasks, or establishing (and keeping) your boundaries, or simply expressing gratitude, or choosing to call out behaviour instead of harbouring resentment unfairly.
        </p><p>
            Equality and equity: Vibes with the above mentioned, I guess.
        </p>
        <p>
        Humour: Yeah, none of us are getting out of this alive, we might as well laugh about it (but not at the expense of anyone else).
        </p>
        <p>
        Creativity, curiosity, and diligence: Everything worth having is hard won. I believe that everyone is limitless in their capability, it just comes down to what they are willing to sacrifice for it. NB: This does NOT mean that there aren't more sacrifices for some due to inequality and inequitable systems that our society runs on. It is not a statement intended to invalidate or reduce those, at all. I believe in everyone's innate ability to achieve whatever they want to - but that doesn't mean I don't recognise that for some that journey will be harder. I want to spend my life making it less so.
    </p><p>
        Gratitude: Because, well, yeah.
    </p><p>
        Do no harm, but take no sh*t.
    </p>
        <h4>Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made and the consequences of the action you took.
        </h4>
        <p>
            This year, I was put in the position of teaching a new colleague's child, X. X mostly participated in classes without event, but refused to complete work throughout the year, only submitting completed projects that were due credits for assessments. For all of their projects, they received a narrow high-margin middle grade. Knowing that I might have inherent bias against X and their work, knowing the support they were receiving and my perception of their attitude towards their work (which was in stark contrast to my own values of diligence and humility), I put X's work in for the first round of moderation so that I could confirm my beliefs about their grade in comparison with the grades other students had received.
        After the grades were published, X's parent, my colleague, took umbrage at the fact X had not received the highest grade in the class. I attempted to justify my position on their work and put forward the evidence I had gathered for where the grade boundary existed, making compassionate consideration for the difficulties of the year in COVID-19. In another assessment, the same thing happened - X submitted work that did not receive the highest grade available. I made sure that I was supervised by another superior to retain the integrity of the grade. This grade was again contested by my colleague, who, in anger, made comments about my competence and that I had unfairly judged their child, X.
        The situation was escalated to Senior Leadership, who agreed with the complaint I put forward:
    </p><ol>
        <li>That my colleague should never have been allowed in moderation meetings due to a conflict of interest,</li>
        <li>That the grade needed to be confirmed by an external moderator.</li>
    </ol>
        <p>Another colleague in the department suggested I should have simply changed the grade to keep the peace.
        </p><p>
        Evidence was sent offsite to an external moderator, who not only upheld the grade, but remarked that I had marked X's work too leniently.
        As a compromise, my grade was upheld and approved. I settled on this, too keep the peace.
    </p><p>
        In reflections with my in-school mentor about the situation, I discussed my reasoning behind the incident. I felt it was unfair that X should have advocacy in moderation when most of my students had none. They did not have the luxury of a parent with a Computer Science degree, nor did they have the luxury of having someone who would happily bias the marking process in their favour. I found the situation distressing, and before the external moderator's remarks were received by the school, I felt horrible. I felt like I was (frankly) being an *sshole by sticking to my guns when both my colleagues (at my level) suggested I should have just changed the kid's grade. I did not believe X had produced work of the standard for that grade, and at the end of the day, my own professional integrity was at stake.
        I did precisely what I could live with. I was lucky that it eventuated as it had. 
        But I have wondered what would have happened had the external moderator returned a higher grade. 
        As it happens, X's work has been consistently at the boundary, and in another moderation meeting I was forced to raise the grade despite protest. 
        This is possibly where my "bias against bias" comes in. I have other students in my classes who are battling untold struggles to participate in school; students who do not have the same privilege as X. And I have struggled, likewise, to give them grades that reflect the work they have produced rather than the grades I think they deserve and are capable of (although, to be frank, I firmly believe all of my students would be capable of the utmost excellence if they were simply given the opportunity and a system that truly meets their needs). 
        I know that I would have obeyed my 'superiors' in this aspect - it is short-sighted to rebel in certain battles and lose the war, so to speak. 
        My colleague and I have overcome this issue thanks to mediation from senior leadership, and I have accepted that no apology will be forthcoming (to keep the peace).
    </p><p>
         </p><p>There are more than a few values and beliefs at play in this scenario:</p>
         <ul>
        <li>My own privilege, paired with my personal values of justice, fairness, diligence, honesty, tenacity, and single-mindedness (which in this situation, acted as a strength). On the one hand, I believe that no one should benefit unfairly over others, which is why I didn't want to give X a grade their work did not meet the standard of. However, as a Pakeha woman, I have unfairly benefited from systemic racism all my life. Professional integrity is another one of my values - and one that I fought to uphold (my actions weren't entirely selfless).
        </li>
        <li>A cultural bias towards individuality. I know that both colleagues were motivated by different personal and cultural values, some of which may have biased the cohesion of the group over the success of one (ironically, the success of one - X - was at the root of this disagreement). While this was an extreme and problematic situation, I preferred to be outcast and stand by my morals than be accepted and change the grade, which I felt was ethically questionable. It may have been one grade - it may not have had any large-ranging consequences - but to me, it was the principle of the thing. To change the grade would be to admit that the grading system was not simply assigned based on the quality of work produced for the standard. When, preposterously, we KNOW that grading is not fair. We know that the entire education system is rotten to the core with unfairness! Yet this one situation was so desperate for me that I demonstrate my own adherence to these morals.
        In some ways, I am proud of myself for surviving that situation intact. I endured verbal abuse from both colleagues to uphold my professional integrity. Was it worth it? Perhaps. I don't really know. Participating in the education system in any way is to embrace the cognitive dissonance of accepting a wider evil to perpetuate a common good. I like to think this is an example of the fact that, "what is right is not always popular", and I think if I am faced with an ethical dilemma, I will choose what I believe to be right - not necessarily what is popular. But then, 'rightness' is always up for question. And there is also the parallel utilitarian ideal of "the greatest good for the most people", and that almost intimates by design that what is popular IS right.
        As you can probably tell, the jury's out on this one.</li>
    </ul>
        <h4>Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.</h4>
        <p>I come from both kings and commoners, as my grandfather (granddad), reminded us. Our family name comes from generations traced to Welsh dynastic families, Powell, but we are also of farmers (Scottish and Irish, and on my mum's side, four generations in Taranaki), and military men. So, I have been raised with the idea that no person is inherently better than another, for any reason, and that service is the most important thing. My mum saw it as important that I learn to be "class mobile", which is probably way more important in the UK than it is here - that I learned to speak with and build relationships with people of all backgrounds. And our family prides itself on hard work, autonomy, and ancestry. Likewise, I'd say I do too. Is that culture? For a half-British, half-Pakeha New Zealander, I'd say perhaps. I know that Welsh people are tough and ancient, and that dynasties are outdated as they are revelrous. I know that my foremothers - my mum, my gran, and those before - have all been uncharacteristically bold for being raised in a patriarchal society. And so am I. I take pride in that there are corners of my ancestry that are left to mystery. I have Jewish and Gypsy ancestors (as any dynastic family has 'outliers'), and perhaps there's nothing more to that than biology, but I see it as tying me to something larger than the lands I've grown up on. Everything else is just stories we've told ourselves. Part of the cultural shift I want to see in my lifetime is undoing the intergenerational trauma done to us, and done by us. That's possibly why I identify more with my purpose than with my past.
        </p>
        <h4>Using the evidence gathered, describe your strengths and limitations.</h4>
        
        <p>My mentor made an observation during the events described above - that I hold myself to a high standard, and I expect the same standard of others. I was listening to a podcast where the presenter paralleled Kobe Bryant's attitude to playing basketball. He was often in tensions with fellow players simply because he expected more of them. Likewise, a strength of my practice as a teacher and team member is from that of the HBR's "High Standards, High Support" approach - I have unrelenting standards, but am willing to go over and above to help others (and myself) meet them. And, (last pop culture reference, perhaps), I like the idea of the "10th man principle" (from World War Z. Yes, a zombie movie! Great for leadership philosophy, apparently - perhaps even more so in the COVID era). In the 10th man principle, it is told that if 9 people read the same information and come to the same conclusion, it is the duty of the 10th to disagree. No matter how preposterous, no matter how improbable, it is their job to dissent and offer an informed opposing view. This isn't as simple as being a troll or a reply-guy on the internet (that in itself is problematic AF), but not simply trusting the group-think. So perhaps, in some ways, I am not uncomfortable being the 10th man.
        There are a bunch of 'metrics' that could support this idea:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>I have previously tested in the MBTI as INTP-T (more recently tested as an INTJ-A, which I think is the influence being a teacher has had on me)
        </li>
        <li>I largely test out with core Enneagram values 1, 8, 5 with wings 2, 3, and 4. Individualistic, perfectionistic, but compassionate.
        </li>
        <li>
        At the Leadership Lab in 2016, I was coached through the StrengthsFinder process, with my top strengths (in order): Learner, Restorative, Individualisation, Achiever, Focus.
    </li><li>
        My top 5 VIA strengths are Creativity, Curiosity, Humour, Bravery, Love of Learning. The next five are Justice, Kindness, Gratitude, Appreciation of Beauty and Excellence, and Love.
    </li>
    </ul>
        <h4>Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development</h4>
        
        <p>I've had to learn how to turn my inward focus and determination towards service, collaboration, and humility. "Softening", as it were, towards myself and others. Where I have previously relied on my single-mindedness as a source of strength and personal success at the expense of my relationships, I now see my relationships as the core metric of my strength and success.
        </p>
        <h4>Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they might intersect with learning obstacles.
        </h4>
        <p>Simply by re-framing obstacles as the learning itself, I can become curious - rather than frustrated - with them.
        </p>
        <h4>Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now, and why.
        </h4>
        <p>I'll refer to the situation above. To be honest, I think the only thing that should have been done differently would be that I requested mediation earlier. Otherwise, the situation has been resolved and we are working positively together again. It's been hard, but these things happen.
