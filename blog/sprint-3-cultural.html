        <h2>Emotional Intelligence and Emotional Categorisation: Is overanalysis and underacknowledgement our downfall?</h2>
        <h3>22 November 2020</h3>
      </section>

      <p>There is possibly no doubt that greater emotional awareness and fluency allows us to better reckon with each other as human beings. But what if there's a downside to the movement of emotional intelligence? In this (short) blog, I seek to work out some weird thoughts I've been having on the language of emotion and how rationalisation can be a tool for 'evil' if put in the wrong hands. Buckle up, me hearties!</p>
      <h4>The Language of Emotional Intelligence</h4>
      <p>While the term 'emotional intelligence' was popularised as recently as the 90s, personality theory - and the idea of how our emotions interact with our ego, and influence the stories we tell ourselves - go way back to ancient philosophy. The modern Myers-Briggs Type Indicator has its roots in Jungian philosophy, stemming from Aristotleian archetypes. The Enneagram, Big Five, and other concepts of personality both pre- and post-date modern astrology (but perhaps not the Gregorian Calendar). As all of us are largely ego-centric at some point in our lives (whether we leave that point or not), the idea of knowing ourselves and rationalising ourselves is not a new one by any stretch of the imagination. <br> The pseudoscience of categorising emotions allows us a common language for transcending the tension created by confusion, from where most conflicts ultimately arise. For this reason, having a language through which we can discuss ourselves and our behaviours and emotional beings, deserving of compassion, is so powerful. "No man knows who he truly is until his life is threatened or he's given power," is a recent quote I've been tickled by, and I think it's appropriate here. Which is why I want to expand on what happens when the power of emotional intelligence - and the many languages we use to communicate it - is put into the wrong hands.</p>

      <h4>Absolute Power Corrupts Absolutely</h4>
      <p>The more you learn about emotions, personality, and the power of human relationships, the more power you wield in yourself and with others. It really is that simple, and it's problematic not to recognise that power and the dynamics it creates. The question is, what do you use this power for? If you understand how your own emotions work, you can likewise learn to accommodate - and sometimes, amend - your emotional response to be more appropriate for the outcome you want. And, with enough intelligence of others' emotional realities, you likewise have an opportunity to manipulate theirs. This sounds pretty sinister, right? Yet, what do you do when you are trying to de-escalate conflict? Or when you're trying to cheer someone up, or make them feel welcome? We don't use the word 'manipulate' here, simply because it sounds controlling and perverse, but that's essentially what those acts are. Would we argue those actions and wishes are bad? To make others feel belonging, safety, unity with us? Well, no, not for the sake of those feelings. But if we're doing them with ulterior motives, that's another story entirely.<br> At this point, I could choose to discuss the more extreme examples of human psychology, such as persistent and malignant personality disorders and how afflicted persons use the language of emotional intelligence and personality theory to manipulate others. However, while I have experienced narcissistic abuse, I am not qualified to speak to these particular afflictions and the damage they can cause. Instead, I think it's more pertinent to speak to the dangerous, grey, middle-ground - how these classifications can be used to 'other' others, and how we can sit with the cognitive dissonance of classifications being both contained and neat - and infinitely open and complex.</p>
