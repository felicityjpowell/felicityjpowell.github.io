        <h2>Emotional Intelligence</h2>

      <h4>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h4>
      <p>Psychology today simply refers to it as "Emotional intelligence refers to the ability to identify and manage oneâ€™s own emotions, as well as the emotions of others.".
      <br>In some ways, I would say the term 'Emotional Intelligence' is passive, when really the intention of developing EQ is an active and constructive interaction between humans as emotional beings.
    </p>
      <h4>
      How is it different to IQ?</h4>
      <p>Well, first, EQ possibly hasn't (yet) been appropriated in the interest of eugenics.
      <br>IQ, or "Intelligence quotient", is used to assess a person's "reasoning" abilities based on a narrow set of standardised tests. Essentially, IQ tests (by which 'IQ' is derived) judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree. These tests rarely consider modern pedagogical theories of multiple intelligences, or cultural co-factors that would alter a persons' approach to 'reasoning' in such a way.
      <br>While having some form of 'metric' to define human intelligence can perhaps be useful in assigning tasks of a similar ilk to those humans, overall, IQ actually tells us very little about human intelligence beyond the biases we have created around it.
      <br>EQ, on the other hand, (the metric associated with Emotional Intelligence), is a much broader concept of measuring one's ability to communicate and adapt to the nuances of communication and interaction we experience as human beings. EQ may not be used to assign jobs, or social status, but can be a mental model through which we develop our own ability to empathise and relate to others, thereby enhancing all interactions be they professional or personal in any number of contexts.
    </p>
      <h4>Why is it important?</h4>
      <p>Understanding how we can improve the way we relate to and interact with others isn't just important, it's vital to our survival. Even in the narrowest sense, humans are social beings and we need positive social interactions to thrive. Developing our emotional intelligence ensures our access to these kinds of positive and nurturing relationships. In a much more broad sense, humanity needs high-emotional-quotient interactions to become the norm in order to affect positive change that considers the implications of any solution posed, with empathy.
